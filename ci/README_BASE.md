# Ricardo Decal's Tools

A collection of command-line utilities and scripts, written to be immediately runnable using `uv run https://tools.ricardodecal.com/python/foo.py`, which spawns a self-contained and ephemeral [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) Python environment.

This is an experiment in low-stakes vibe coding. The code lives in [`crypdick/tools`](https://github.com/crypdick/tools).

Inspired by [Simon Willison's tools collection](https://github.com/simonw/tools).
