# Ricardo Decal's Tools

A collection of simple, self-contained tools in two flavors:

- **Scripts** — Python CLI tools runnable with `uv run https://tools.ricardodecal.com/python/foo.py`, which spawns a self-contained and ephemeral [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) environment.
- **Pages** — Single-file HTML tools that run entirely in your browser at `https://tools.ricardodecal.com/html/foo.html`.

This is an experiment in low-stakes vibe coding. The code lives in [`crypdick/tools`](https://github.com/crypdick/tools).

Inspired by [Simon Willison's tools collection](https://github.com/simonw/tools).
